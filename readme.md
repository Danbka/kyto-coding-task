## Kyto Coding Task

### Installation

Clone repository and install dependencies via composer

``composer install --no-dev``

### Usage

Example of usage you can find in ``index.php`` file.

### Assumptions

Unlike Tree, Star generation algorithm is unclear. That's why I decided to hardcode it. 

### Run tests

Install dev-dependencies via composer

``compose install --dev``

and run

``vendor\bin\phpunit tests``
